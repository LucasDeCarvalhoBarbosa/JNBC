# JNBC
JNBC or Java Number Base Converter, is a specialized library for making conversions between bases.  

It supports conversions between the most used bases such as decimal, binary, octal, hexadecimal, but its greatest advantage is the creation of its own bases with characters supported by the primitive char.  

__Example of possible bases:__
|Base|Symbols|Example|Result|
|--|--|--|--|
|2|0, 1|1010|10|
|8|0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7|47|39|
|5|a, b, c, d, e|abc|7|
|6|<, >, :, (,), p|>:(|51|
|8|∑, ∆, ₪, ¥, §, ʢ, ∞, Ω|Ω∆∑|456|

It is still possible to write bases with many more symbols!
